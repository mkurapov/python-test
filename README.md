# Shapes Calculator

shapes calculator implemented using python.

## Background

The business department at xyz inc. has a team that manually calculates the area of various
shapes using a calculator. The type and dimension of the shapes are found on pages and upon
pages of computer print out.  An astute intern from the engineering department decided to help the 
business department by volunteering and automating the calculation process. However, little did the intern know that the print out actually came from a complex
process that involved a mainframe computer and monkeys and NLP.  Alas, all of the poor intern's
time was spent figuring out how to automate and parse the input.  

What you see in this repo is the actual calculator code that the intern spent 5 minutes on.
It does the job but isn't the prettiest code on earth.  But the parsing code is able to call 
this calculator script and get the resulting area from it using the existing script's
commandline interface.

Please help the intern complete the list of todos.

### Todos

* Complete the radius calculation.
  * Use any programming language you're comfortable with.
* We may need to support diameter calculations for circles.
* Must demonstrate object oriented programing principles.
* Demonstrate error checking.
* Unit tests are desireable.

### Running Calculator.py
```
python calculator.py -h
